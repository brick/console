Introduction
------------

To be written.

Project status & release process
--------------------------------

This library is under development.

The current releases are numbered `0.x.y`. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), `y` is incremented.

**When a breaking change is introduced, a new `0.x` version cycle is always started.**

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as `0.1.*`.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history](https://github.com/brick/console/releases)
for a list of changes introduced by each further `0.x.0` version.

Installation
------------

This library is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require brick/console
```

Requirements
------------

This library requires PHP 7.1 or later.
